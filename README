This repository contains testcases for conveting Openstreetmap-Data into GIS world formats.

Each test has its own directory containing numbered osm/osc files and the expedted results after each step in different output formats.
After each step only the output of one OSM-Object is relevant. Which object is the one to be checked depends on the kind of testcase.

Individual testcases:

1. Output by closed ways:
 In all of these testcases the Output generated by a single closed way is checked. 
 If you want to check for numerical equality you may want to give a reasonable epsilon, 
 since the reference output was calculated in google mercator projection and reprojected to lat/lon.
 So there are small rounding differenced beween input and reference output.
 Each test contains:
    0.osm: The Input .osm file
    0_output.svg: The expedted output geometry represented as svg image. This file is intended for visual control by the developer.
    0_output.wkt: The expedted output geometry represented as wkt.
    0_output.wkb: The expedted output geometry represented as wkb.
    README: Explanation of the test for the developer
